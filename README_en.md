# Campus Network Solution for Dormitories at Guangdong University of Education
This solution addresses common issues with the campus network in dormitories at Guangdong University of Education, such as network lag, insufficient bandwidth, limited number of connectable devices, and inability to access certain websites. The core approach is to bypass campus network monitoring by custom-compiling the OpenWRT firmware and optimizing network settings, thereby enhancing the smoothness and flexibility of network usage. It should be noted that the ideas and methods of this solution are also applicable to campus networks of other universities and are for reference and technical exchange only.


## I. Background and Purpose of the Solution
During my high school years, I was long restricted by the Shunde District Education Network and deeply experienced the impact of network limitations on learning and daily life. After enrolling in Guangdong University of Education, I found that the dormitory campus network had similar problems: video lag during peak hours, frequent disconnections when multiple devices were connected to the network, and inability to access certain external websites required for learning. These issues directly affected online courses, information retrieval, and daily network usage.

Currently, campus network management in domestic universities has formed a mature technical chain. On the front end, terminal detection is implemented through multi-dimensional methods such as User-Agent feature recognition, timestamp dynamic verification, and IPID sequence tracking. On the back end, access blocking is carried out by means of IP address pollution, DNS resolution hijacking, and HTTP response redirection to the campus intranet 404 page. This "detection-response" mechanism loop is the main technical barrier to the free use of the campus network.

Based on the basic knowledge of computer compilation principles and the understanding of the modular architecture of the OpenWRT firmware, I systematically deconstructed the campus network management logic through technical approaches such as custom firmware compilation, protocol stack parameter optimization, and application-layer proxy policy configuration. Finally, this practical and scalable dormitory network optimization solution was formed.


## II. QA and Disclaimer
<details>

### 1. Why is this technology open-sourced? Won't the campus network take measures to fix network vulnerabilities?
- Campus network operation and maintenance engineers pay much more attention to technical trends than ordinary students, so there is no such situation as "not knowing". The core reason for not fixing is that **it is technically impossible to fix effectively**.  
- Various detection methods of the campus network are formulated based on patent applications and relevant national standard documents issued by the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China. The anti-detection technology of this solution fully complies with the national standard requirements. The principle is to aggregate all network devices in the dormitory into "one IP, one MAC, one UA" for internet access, which is completely consistent with the characteristics of a single device accessing the internet normally. The detection device cannot distinguish between the aggregated device and a single device, and it is even more impossible to block the terminal that accesses the internet normally.  
- From the perspective of operation and maintenance costs, campus network maintenance is restricted by both equipment costs and maintenance costs: adding new detection methods will interfere with the accuracy of the original detection and require more hardware resources to be invested; if detection rules are added blindly, the performance of the campus server will be significantly slowed down, which will affect the internet experience of all teachers and students and the normal teaching progress.  
- From the perspective of processes and practical operations, operation and maintenance personnel need to ask superiors for instructions at all levels and coordinate testing in many ways to adjust the detection strategy, and it is difficult to accurately distinguish between "normal devices" and "aggregated devices". In contrast, this solution only involves technical configuration and has no additional process resistance.

### 2. Will deploying this project pose security risks or legal risks?
**There are no security risks or legal risks**, so you can deploy it with confidence.  

The anti-detection logic of this project is summarized based on the author's long-term technical exploration. It does not involve the modification or damage of campus network equipment throughout the process. All configurations comply with the requirements of national standard documents and do not break through the basic usage framework of the campus network. There is no need to worry about legal or security issues.

### 3. How to solve other problems not mentioned?
If you encounter difficult problems not covered in the solution, you are welcome to leave a message in the **issues** section of the project's GitHub repository. I will reply and assist in solving the problem in a timely manner after seeing it.

</details>


## III. Preparation Stage
### 1. Hardware Equipment
- **Main Router Device**: An x86-64 architecture device with dual network ports (such as an industrial computer, a mini host) is required, or other motherboards that support flashing the OpenWRT system (such as an ARM architecture development board) to ensure that it can connect to both the campus network incoming line and lower-level devices at the same time. This solution uses the X86-64 architecture as an example for demonstration.
- **Wireless Access Point (AP)**: Prepare a router with wireless function as an AP to expand the WiFi coverage. It is recommended to use a model that supports the 802.11ac protocol or above to ensure the wireless rate.

### 2. Compilation Environment
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu (recommended 20.04/22.04 LTS version) or other Linux distributions must be used. This solution uses Ubuntu as an example for operation demonstration.
- **Configuration Requirements**: It is recommended to have at least 4GB of memory, 20GB of free hard disk space, and a processor that supports multi-threading to speed up the compilation process.

### 3. Tool Software
- **PE System**: Used to boot the device and write the firmware. It is recommended to use pure version PE tools such as WeiPE or Dabaicai.
- **Disk Writing Tool**: [DiskImage](https://sourceforge.net/projects/diskimage/files/latest/download) (download link), used to write the compiled OpenWRT image to the hard disk.
- If the above tools cannot be downloaded, you can download the backup tools in the releases of the project.

### 4. Other Preparations
- Campus network account and password: Used to verify and access the campus network.
- USB flash drive (8GB or more): Used to make a PE boot disk and store firmware files.
- Network cables (at least two): Used to connect the campus network interface to the main router, and the main router to the AP device respectively.

### 5. Instructions for Students Who Are Not Proficient in Operations

```

**Tip**: If an error occurs during the process, there is no need to panic. After all downloads are completed, you can execute this command again to re-download the files with errors.

### 18. Compile the OpenWRT System
1. Enter the following command to start compilation:
```bash
make -j$(nproc) V=cs
```

**Tip**: During compilation, ensure that the available running memory of the device is greater than 4GB; select "y" for all when functional options pop up to ensure the compatibility of OpenWRT with the device. If an Error occurs, you can first execute the following command to clean the environment, and then re-execute the compilation command:
```bash
make clean
make dirclean  # More thorough cleaning, which will delete the downloaded packages and configurations
```

### 19. Find the Compilation Result
After the compilation is completed, the image file (in .img format) will be stored in the `./bin/target/x86/64/` directory (the "x86" and "64" in the path are consistent with the architecture selected during compilation).
![Project Logo](https://github.com/liang1481624299/gdei_openwrt/blob/main/photo/23.png)
