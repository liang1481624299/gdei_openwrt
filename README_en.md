# Campus Network Dormitory Optimization Solution for Guangdong University of Education
This solution addresses common issues with the campus network in dormitories of Guangdong University of Education, including network lag, insufficient bandwidth, limited number of connectable devices, and inaccessibility to certain websites. The core approach involves custom-compiling OpenWRT firmware and optimizing network settings to bypass campus network monitoring, thereby enhancing the smoothness and flexibility of network usage. It should be noted that the ideas and methods of this solution are also applicable to campus networks of other universities, and are for reference and technical exchange only.


## 1. Background and Purpose of the Solution
During my high school years, I was restricted by the Shunde District Education Network for a long time, and deeply experienced the impact of network restrictions on study and daily life. After enrolling in Guangdong University of Education, I found similar issues with the dormitory campus network: video lag during peak hours, frequent disconnections when multiple devices are connected simultaneously, and inaccessibility to some external websites required for study. These problems directly affect online courses, information retrieval, and daily network use.

Currently, the campus network management system in domestic universities has formed a mature technical chain:
- Frontend detection: Terminal detection is implemented through multi-dimensional methods such as User-Agent feature recognition, timestamp dynamic verification, and IPID sequence tracking.
- Backend blocking: Access blocking is carried out by means of IP address pollution, DNS resolution hijacking, and HTTP response redirection to the campus internal 404 page.

This closed-loop "detection-response" mechanism is the main technical barrier to the free use of the campus network.

Based on basic knowledge of computer compilation principles and an understanding of the modular architecture of OpenWRT firmware, I systematically deconstructed the campus network management logic through technical approaches such as custom firmware compilation, protocol stack parameter optimization, and application-layer proxy policy configuration. Eventually, this dormitory network optimization solution with both practicality and scalability was developed.


## 2. Preparation Phase
### 1. Hardware Equipment
- **Main Router Device**: A device with dual network ports and x86-64 architecture (such as an industrial computer or mini host) is required, or other motherboards that support flashing the OpenWRT system (such as ARM architecture development boards). It should be able to connect both the campus network incoming line and subordinate devices simultaneously. This solution uses the X86-64 architecture for demonstration.
- **Wireless Access Point (AP)**: Prepare a router with wireless functionality as an AP to extend WiFi coverage. It is recommended to choose a model that supports the 802.11ac protocol or above to ensure wireless speed.

### 2. Compilation Environment
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu (version 20.04/22.04 LTS is recommended) or other Linux distributions must be used. This solution uses Ubuntu for operation demonstration.
- **Configuration Requirements**: At least 4GB of memory and 20GB of free hard disk space are recommended. The processor should support multi-threading to speed up the compilation process.

### 3. Tool Software
- **PE System**: Used to boot the device and write the firmware. Pure version PE tools such as Micro PE or Dabaicai PE are recommended.
- **Disk Writing Tool**: [DiskImage](https://sourceforge.net/projects/diskimage/files/latest/download) (download link), used to write the compiled OpenWRT image to the hard disk.
- If download fails or for other reasons, you can download it from the "releases" section of the project.

### 4. Other Preparations
- Campus network account and password: Used to authenticate and access the campus network.
- USB flash drive (8GB or larger): Used to make a PE boot disk and store firmware files.
- Network cables (at least two): One for connecting the campus network interface to the main router, and the other for connecting the main router to the AP device.

### 5. Notes for Users with Little Operational Experience
If you cannot complete the following operations independently, you can directly use the following commands to download the pre-configured files for compilation, or download the already compiled img file from the "releases" section:
```
git clone https://github.com/liang1481624299/gdei_openwrt.git
cd gdei_openwrt
```

<details>
<summary>üìå Click to expand: Frequently Asked Questions (QA)</summary>

### 1. Why is this technology open-sourced, and why doesn't the campus network take measures to fix network vulnerabilities?
- Campus network operation and maintenance engineers pay much more attention to technical trends than ordinary students, so there is no such situation as "not knowing". The core reason for not fixing is that **effective technical fixes are not possible**.
- Various detection methods of the campus network are formulated based on patent applications and relevant national standard documents issued by the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China. However, the anti-detection technology of this solution fully complies with national standards. Its principle is to aggregate all network devices in the dormitory into "one IP, one MAC, and one UA" for internet access, which is completely consistent with the characteristics of a single device accessing the internet normally. Detection devices cannot distinguish between aggregated devices and single devices, and it is even more impossible to block terminals that access the internet normally.
- From the perspective of operation and maintenance costs, campus network maintenance is restricted by both equipment costs and maintenance costs: adding new detection methods will interfere with the accuracy of existing detection and require more hardware resources; if detection rules are increased blindly, the performance of campus servers will be significantly slowed down, which will affect the internet experience of all teachers and students and the normal teaching progress.
- From the perspective of process and practical operation, operation and maintenance personnel need to report to superiors at all levels, coordinate and test in multiple parties when adjusting detection strategies, and it is difficult to accurately distinguish between "normal devices" and "aggregated devices". In contrast, this solution only involves technical configuration and has no additional process obstacles.

### 2. Will deploying this project pose any security risks or legal risks?
There are **no security risks or legal risks**, and it can be deployed with confidence.

The anti-detection logic of this project is summarized based on long-term personal technical exploration. It does not involve modification or damage to campus network equipment throughout the process. All configurations comply with the requirements of national standard documents and do not exceed the basic usage framework of the campus network. There is no need to worry about legal or security issues.

### 3. How to solve other unmentioned problems?
If you encounter problems not covered in this solution, you are welcome to leave a message in the **issues** section of the project's GitHub repository. I will reply and assist in solving the problem in a timely manner after seeing it.
