# Campus Network Solution for Dormitories at Guangdong University of Education
This solution addresses common issues with the campus network in dormitories at Guangdong University of Education, including network lag, insufficient bandwidth, limited number of connectable devices, and inaccessibility to certain websites. Its core approach is to enhance network fluency and flexibility by custom-compiling OpenWRT firmware and optimizing network settings to bypass campus network monitoring. It should be noted that the concepts and methods of this solution are also applicable to campus networks of other universities, and are provided for reference and technical exchange only.


## I. Background and Purpose of the Solution
During my high school years, I was restricted by the Shunde District Education Network for a long time, which gave me a deep understanding of how network restrictions affect learning and daily life. After enrolling in Guangdong University of Education, I found similar issues with the dormitory campus network: video lag during peak hours, frequent disconnections when multiple devices are connected, and inaccessibility to some external websites required for learning. These problems directly impact online course participation, information retrieval, and daily network use.

Currently, campus network management and control in domestic universities have formed a mature technical chain. On the front end, terminal detection is implemented through multi-dimensional methods such as User-Agent feature recognition, dynamic timestamp verification, and IPID sequence tracking. On the back end, access blocking is carried out via IP address pollution, DNS resolution hijacking, and HTTP response redirection to the campus 404 page. This closed-loop "detection-response" mechanism is the main technical barrier to the free use of the campus network.

Based on my basic understanding of computer compilation principles and the modular architecture of OpenWRT firmware, I systematically deconstructed the campus network management logic through technical approaches including custom firmware compilation, protocol stack parameter optimization, and application-layer proxy strategy configuration. Ultimately, this practical and scalable dormitory network optimization solution was developed.


## II. QA and Disclaimer
<details>
<summary>üìå Click to expand: Frequently Asked Questions (QA)</summary>

### 1. Why is this technology open-sourced? Won‚Äôt the campus network take measures to fix potential vulnerabilities?
- Campus network operation and maintenance engineers pay far more attention to technical developments than ordinary students, so there is no "lack of awareness" about such technologies. The core reason for not fixing it is that **it is technically impossible to fix effectively**.  
- All detection methods used by the campus network are based on patent applications and relevant national standard documents issued by the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China. The anti-detection technology in this solution fully complies with national standards. Its principle is to aggregate all network devices in the dormitory into a single unit for internet access, appearing as "one IP, one MAC, one UA". This is identical to the characteristics of a single device accessing the network normally, so detection tools cannot distinguish between aggregated devices and single devices, and it is even impossible to block terminals that access the network normally.  
- From the perspective of operation and maintenance costs, campus network maintenance is constrained by both equipment costs and maintenance costs. Adding new detection methods will interfere with the accuracy of existing detection and require more hardware resources. Blindly increasing detection rules will significantly slow down campus server performance, which in turn affects the network experience of all teachers and students and normal teaching progress.  
- From the perspective of processes and practical operations, operation and maintenance personnel need to report to superiors at all levels and coordinate testing from multiple parties to adjust detection strategies. Additionally, it is difficult to accurately distinguish between "normal devices" and "aggregated devices". In contrast, this solution only involves technical configuration and has no additional process obstacles.

### 2. Are there any security or legal risks in deploying this project?
There are **no security or legal risks**, and it can be deployed with confidence.  

The anti-detection logic of this project is summarized based on long-term personal technical exploration. It does not involve modifying or damaging campus network equipment throughout the process. All configurations comply with the requirements of national standard documents and do not exceed the basic usage framework of the campus network. There is no need to worry about legal or security issues.

### 3. How to resolve other issues not mentioned in the solution?
If you encounter difficult problems not covered in this solution, please leave a message in the **issues** section of the project‚Äôs GitHub repository. I will reply and assist in resolving the issue promptly after seeing the message.

</details>


## III. Preparation Stage
### 1. Hardware Equipment
- **Main Router Device**: An x86-64 architecture device with dual network ports (such as an industrial computer or mini host) is required, or other motherboards that support flashing the OpenWRT system (such as ARM architecture development boards). Ensure it can connect to both the campus network input line and subordinate devices simultaneously. This solution uses the X86-64 architecture for demonstration.
- **Wireless Access Point (AP)**: Prepare one router with wireless functionality as an AP to expand WiFi coverage. It is recommended to choose a model that supports the 802.11ac protocol or above to ensure wireless speed.

### 2. Compilation Environment
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu (version 20.04/22.04 LTS is recommended) or other Linux distributions must be used. This solution uses Ubuntu for operation demonstration.
- **Configuration Requirements**: At least 4GB of memory and 20GB of free hard disk space are recommended. The processor should support multi-threading to accelerate the compilation speed.

### 3. Tool Software
- **PE System**: Used to boot the device and write firmware. It is recommended to use pure-version PE tools such as WeiPE or Dabaicai.
- **Disk Writing Tool**: [DiskImage](https://sourceforge.net/projects/diskimage/files/latest/download) (download link), used to write the compiled OpenWRT image to the hard disk.
- If you cannot download the above tools, alternative tools can be downloaded from the project‚Äôs releases section.

### 4. Other Preparations
- Campus Network Account and Password: Used to authenticate and access the campus network.
- USB Flash Drive (8GB or larger): Used to create a PE boot disk and store firmware files.
- Network Cables (at least two): One for connecting the campus network interface to the main router, and the other for connecting the main router to the AP device.

### 5. Instructions for Users Unfamiliar with Operations
If you cannot complete the subsequent operations independently, you can directly use the following commands to download the pre-configured files for compilation, or go directly to the releases section to download the already compiled img file (you can skip directly to Step 4-16):
```
git clone https://github.com/liang1481624299/gdei_openwrt.git
cd gdei_openwrt
make kernel_menuconfig -j$(nproc) V=cs
```


## IV. Start Compilation
### 1. Clone OpenWRT Source Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git --branch=openwrt-23.05
```

### 2. Copy the Source Code
To avoid affecting the original code due to operational errors, first make a copy and perform compilation in the copied version:
```bash
cp -r openwrt openwrt_2
```

### 3. Enter the Copied Folder
```bash
cd openwrt_2
```

### 4. Update Software Package Sources
```bash
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
```

### 5. Clone Core Plugin Source Code
