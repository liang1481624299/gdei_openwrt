Description:   Netatalk is an Open Source Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) fileserver.
  Implements a service that allows Macintosh file sharing
  and Time Machine backups. Modern MacOS prefers Samba network shares
  but AFP has shown superior throughput. High Sierra and older MacOS
  only support AFP for Time Machine backups.
  Includes support of AppleTalk protocols to network with pre-OSX Macs.
